# Python - Data Science Essentials
## Date: 13th October, 2020 - Present

This repository focuses on my learning path of Python for Data Science. 

Here, I haven't included the files of Chapter 1, since there was no practical implementation of it. It focussed more on the introductory part and the professional careers in this field.
However, I am listing out few points regarding the same.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to the Data Professions

### The Four Flavours of Data Science
- Data Analysis
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning

## Chapter 2 - Data Preparation Basics
- Filtering & selecting
- Treating missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Concatenating and transforming
- Grouping and aggregation
